# 1D binary classification

**Is X positive?**

This project considers a model with a single variable X, and has 2 output classes "Yes" and "No".
The output class is "No" if X is negative and "Yes" if X is positive.
I provide only integer values for inputs and cross-validate and test with integers and floats.
